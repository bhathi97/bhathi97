Hi...! I'm Bhathiya Akalanka Ranaweera Bandara. I am a student, a programmer, a baseball player, and a responsible person. I live in Kandy. My native language is Sinhala, but I am fluent in English and some Tamil.

I want to learn new things that can broaden my horizons. My personal skills include time management, problem solving, creative thinking, teamwork, leadership and organizational skills. I'm a multitasker, but I can do my best by adding new value to a goal by pursuing one goal at a time.

Skills: java / Electronics / SQL / javaScript / C / R / python / IOT / arduino
